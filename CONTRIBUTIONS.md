# Expected Team Contributions

## Expectations
As a team, we expect all members to complete their required sections in a reasonable time (max 4-6 hours) and before deadlines. If team members cannot complete their sections within the maximum hours, members should give notice on Discord at least 24 hours before the group submission date (depending per milestone) to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes ensuring all scripts are working, creating tests for functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

## Meetings
Official meeting times were established during the initial team meeting held on 2023-01-31. Sessions will be held after DSCI 310 Lecture (Tues) weekly from 10:30 am - 12:00 pm. All members must notify if they are unable to attend at least 1 hour before. In addition, our group plans on holding meetings on discord in case of anything urgent that may arise throughout the duration of the project.

## Communication
All communication outside of the meetings will be through Discord, Slack, or Github. Discord and Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Discord will also be used as our primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

## Reviews
All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate. Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.
